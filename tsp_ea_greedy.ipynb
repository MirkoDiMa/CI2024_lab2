    "# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) - Genetic Algorithm and Greedy Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an implementation of both the Genetic Algorithm and the Greedy Algorithm for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** on multiple datasets. The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genetic Algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, whereas the Greedy Algorithm is a heuristic that builds a solution step-by-step, choosing the nearest unvisited city at each step.\n",
